# FCEV Matlab Simulation
This repository is a space for version control for the MIT Electric Vehicle Team's hydrogen vehicle simulation in MATLAB SIMULINK, graphs, other data, and more. Please note that most of this repository involves combining other simulation examples released by MATHWORKS. A full guide on how to use our simulator will be released with the first version/release of the simulator.
