# FCEV Matlab Simulation

This branch starts with the FCEV Matlab Refence Application seen here (https://www.mathworks.com/help/autoblks/ug/fuel-cell-electric-vehicle-reference-application.html), and then attempts to modify it to our own Motorcycle. Here are some notes.

**To open the application**
- Open MATLAB
- Open the **/FCEV-Matlab-Simulation/FCEV** folder
- in the **/FCEV-Matlab-Simulation/FCEV/FCEV** folder open **FCEV.prj**
- click on "FCEvReferenceApplication in the top **System Model** section
- Hit the **power analysis** button and run the live script to see the data

NOTE
- other projects include **Vehicle Config** which will become necessary later

**this has only been tested on R2022a, it did NOT work in 2023a**
