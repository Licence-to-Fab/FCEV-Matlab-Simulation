Version 1.2

## Introduction

This is a MATLAB&reg; Project containing
a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) model and
its components such as
motor, high voltage battery, and longitudinal vehicle.
This project demonstrates Simscape's modular and
multi-fidelity modeling technology.

The abstract BEV model is built in a simple and modular fashion,
and it can run faster than real-time.
It is suitable as a baseline model for drive cycle simulation
to estimate vehicle's electrical efficiency and
other vehicle-level information.

This project also contains the model of a detailed
permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) and controller.
It captures the detailed behaviors of the AC motor drive unit
and can estimate the electrical efficiency at the unit level.

A Live Script demonstrates how to obtain the electrical efficiency
from the slow but detailed motor drive unit and use the result
as the block parameter of the simple but fast motor drive block
in the BEV model.

## What's New in 1.2 (May, 2022)

- Unit tests were added to some models.
- GitHub Actions continuous integration is used
  to automatically run tests when the repository
  at github.com receives a push.
- This project requires MATLAB R2022a or newer.
- Abstract high-voltage battery component has
  three different fidelity levels;
  **isothermal** (same as before),
  **simple thermal** (newly added using
  System-Level Battery block from Simscape Driveline),
  and **thermal** (newly added using
  Battery block from Simscape Electrical).
  They all run fast.
