# Simscape Custom Component Library for Detailed Battery Model

Simscape lets you create
[a custom component library using Simscape Language][url-ssl].
Blocks to build detailed high voltage battery models
are implemented in the `+batteryModule` package folder.
Detailed battery models used as a detailed model application
are built with this custom library.

You can build the `batteryModule_lib` custom library from
the `+batteryModule` folder with the [`ssc_build` build command][url-cmd]
or by running the `BatteryHVDetailed_buildLibrary.m` script.
For more information about building Simscape custom library,
see [Building Custom Block Libraries][url-steps]
For more examples of Simscape custom components,
see [Creating Custom Components and Libraries - Examples][url-ex].

Simscape custom component library needs to be built for
each operating system.
For more information, see [When to Rebuild a Custom Library][url-rebuild].
