# Change Log

## Version 1.2.2 (December, 2022)

- Fixed a broken link in the main script.
- Minor change in the value of road-load parameter A
  for the main BEV model.

## Version 1.2 (May, 2022)

Highlight

- GitHub Actions continuous integration has been enabled
  to automatically run tests
  when the repository at github.com recieves a push.
- Unit tests and harness models for the tests have been added
  to the BEV system model (`BEV`),
  high-voltage battery (`BatteryHighVoltage`) component,
  longitudinal vehicle (`Vehicle1D`) component, and
  detailed high-voltage battery (`BatteryHighVoltageDetailed`) component.
  More tests will be added in the coming updates.

MATLAB Release

- This version requires MATLAB R2022a or newer.

Project

- Files and folders were reorganized.
  `BEV` and `Components` folders contain abstract models only.
  Detailed models have been moved under `DetailedModelApplications` folder.

Models

- DAESSC solver is used.
- Simulink model files are saved in `mdl` format.
  Starting from R2021b, MDL format is based the new text format
  which is feature parity with binary SLX format.
- Abstract high-voltage battery component has
  three different fidelity levels;
  **isothermal** (same as before),
  **simple thermal** (newly added using
  System-Level Battery block from Simscape Driveline),
  and **thermal** (newly added using
  Battery block from Simscape Electrical).
  They all run fast.
- Longitudinal Vehicle block from Simscape Driveline is
  added as a new (and default) referenced subsystem.
  The previous custom block is still included too.

## Version 1.1 (October, 2021)

- A detailed high-voltage battery pack component is added.
- The BEV model supports three different component configurations
  using Subsystem Reference:
  1) All basic comopnents (same as version 1.0).
  2) [New] With a detailed high-voltage battery as grouped-single module.
  3) [New] With a detailed high-voltage battery as multi-module.
- A live script evaluating the BEV model with
  high-voltage battery component at different fidelity levels
  is added.
- This project requires MATLAB R2020b or newer.

## Version 1.0 (November, 2020)
